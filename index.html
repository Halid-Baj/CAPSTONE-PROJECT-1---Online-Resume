            <h2>Summary: </h2><br>
            <p>I am a 20 year old front end developer wanna be. I have acquired various different skills, skills that allow me to make websites and know my way around computers. My Web Developer journey started 1 year ago, obtaining my diploma in Web Dev front-end and back-end. Something about sitting down anywhere with my laptop and code editor open, knowing I could perhaps make the next apple website, makes me feel a certain type of way.</p>
