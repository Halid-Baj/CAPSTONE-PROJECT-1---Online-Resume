            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gaming</strong> - When I was younger, I used to game a lot. It's actually one of the reasons as to why I have always been interested in computers and technology.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Travelling</strong> - I love seeing new places. Different ways of living and environments in other countries really interests me</li><br>
                <li><strong>Tennis</strong> - A word beyond 'love' is what I would use to describe my passion and interest for tennis. I used to train when I was young 8+ years, and now just train on my own sometimes when I have time.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Coding</strong> - I mean I coded this website, so obviously I would have to list coding as one of my hobbies and interests. Something about being able to make anything that comes to mind into an actual app or website, now thats cool.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Gym</strong> - This and tennis kinda go hand in hand, in terms of staying active and fit. I believe everyone should in some way be participating in fitness activites at least 3-4 a day. It's how we can become healthy and maintain that health level.</li>
